# NOTE : The product owner is in charge of the product backlog
# The product owner rates the importance of each item to the organization ranging from very high to very low or another method.

# Has Priority 1, lowest Priority
def resetPassword(password):
	print(password)

# Has Priority 10, highest Priority
def configureViewData(ViewData):
	print(ViewData)

# The Method with the highest Priority should be implemented first
# The work that the team commits to tackle in a Sprint is the Sprint backlog, and this is separate from the product backlog. 
# The Sprint backlog does not change during the sprint. Items are considered complete and removed from both the Sprint and product backlogs when they are “done done.”
