## What is Scrum?

**Scrum** is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. The framework begins with a simple premise: Start with what can be seen or known. After that, track the progress and tweak as necessary. The three pillars of Scrum are **transparency**, **inspection** and **adaptation**.</br>
The framework, which is often part of **Agile** software development, is named for a rugby formation. Everyone plays a role. When it comes to product development, **Scrum roles** include **product owner**, **Scrum master** and **Scrum development team**.</br>

**Product owner**: This team member serves as the liaison between the development team and its customers. The **product owner** is responsible for ensuring expectations for the completed product have been communicated and agreed upon.</br>

**Scrum master**: This team member serves as a facilitator. The **Scrum master** is responsible for ensuring that Scrum best practices are carried out and the project is able to move forward.</br>

**Scrum development team**: This is a group that works together for creating and testing incremental releases of the final product.
