## What is Scrum? ‚ùì

**Scrum** is a framework for project management that emphasizes teamwork, accountability and iterative progress toward a well-defined goal. The framework begins with a simple premise: Start with what can be seen or known. After that, track the progress and tweak as necessary. The three pillars of Scrum are **transparency**, **inspection** and **adaptation**.</br>
The framework, which is often part of **Agile** software development, is named for a rugby formation. Everyone plays a role. When it comes to product development, **Scrum roles** include **product owner**, **Scrum master** and **Scrum development team**.</br>

**Product owner**: This team member serves as the liaison between the development team and its customers. The **product owner** is responsible for ensuring expectations for the completed product have been communicated and agreed upon.</br>

**Scrum master**: This team member serves as a facilitator. The **Scrum master** is responsible for ensuring that Scrum best practices are carried out and the project is able to move forward.</br>

**Scrum development team**: This is a group that works together for creating and testing incremental releases of the final product.

## The Scrum process üìÖ

The **Scrum process** encourages practitioners to work with what they have and continually evaluate what is working and what is not working. **Communication**, which is an important part of the process, is **carried out through meetings, called Events**. **Scrum Events** include:

**Daily Scrum**. The **Daily Scrum** is a **short stand-up meeting** that happens **at the same place and time each day**. At each meeting, **the team reviews work that was completed the previous day and plans what work will be done in the next 24 hours**. **This is the time for team members to speak up about any problems that might prevent project completion**.

**Sprint Planning Meeting**. A **Sprint** refers to the **time frame in which work must be completed**, and **it's often 30 days**. **Everyone participates in setting the goals**, and **at the end**, **at least one increment -- a usable piece of software -- should be produced**.

**Sprint Review**. **This is the time to show off the increment**.

**Sprint Retrospective**. A **Sprint Retrospective** is **a meeting that's held after a Sprint ends**. During this meeting, **everyone reflects on the Sprint process**. A team-building exercise may also be offered. An important goal of a Sprint Retrospective is **continuous improvement**.
